# 🎯 Tic-Tac-Toe AI — Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

## 📋 Overview
This project implements a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game where an AI opponent plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm, further enhanced with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize performance.
The assignment's goal is to understand decision trees, AI strategies, and optimization techniques in turn-based games.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Tic-Tac-Toe Game Logic — Standard 3x3 grid with win/draw conditions.

✅ AI Player with Minimax — Always makes the best move.

✅ Alpha-Beta Pruning — Speeds up AI move calculations by pruning unnecessary branches.

✅ Performance Comparison — Demonstrates efficiency gains.

✅ Demo Video — Walkthrough of AI in action.

## ⚙️ How to Run
Clone this repository.

Open main.cpp in any modern C++ compiler.

Play against the AI and observe its decision-making!
